# Protect the Clients

# IPv4 rules will perform the following actions:

# - Accept established, related and untracked connections;
# - FastTrack established and related connections (currently only IPv4);
# - Drop invalid connections;
# - Drop bad forward IPs, since we cannot reliably determine in RAW chains which packets are forwarded
# - Drop connections initiated from the internet (from the WAN side which is not destination NAT`ed);
# - Drop bogon IPs that should not be forwarded.
